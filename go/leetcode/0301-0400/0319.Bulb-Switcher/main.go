Observation #1:
A bulb is ON if it is toggled odd times: (ON), (ON -> OFF -> ON), (ON -> OFF -> ON -> OFF -> ON) ...
A bulb is OFF if it is toggled even times: (ON -> OFF), (ON -> OFF -> ON -> OFF ) ...

Observation #2:
Once we reach and toggle the i-th bulb, it will never be touched anymore.

for exmaple, let n = 5 ( changes in each round denoted as bold ), initial state is all OFF:
1-th round : ON, ON, ON, ON, ON
2-nd round: ON, OFF, ON, OFF, ON
3-rd round : ON, OFF, OFF, OFF, ON
4-th round : ON, OFF, OFF, ON, ON
5-th round : ON, OFF, OFF, ON, OFF

You can see that, after each round, all bulbs before that round will not be touched anymore.

So, given a bulb at position X, how do I know it will be toggled EVEN/ODD times ?
Answer: We can find the number of divisors of X.

for example, if the position of a bulb is 3, its divisor is [1,3], that mean we will toggle the 3-rd bulb at 1-st round and 3-rd round:
Combine the observation above,
at 3-rd round, the third bulb will have been toggeld even times ( [1,3] ), so it is OFF. And it will not be changed later on round.
at 5-th round, the fifth bulb will have been toggled even times ( [1,5] ), so it is OFF. And it will not be changed later on round.

Suppose we have a func to get all divisors of i : getDivisors(int), a simple algorithm can be deduced:
for i = 1..n, if getDivisors(i) % 2 == 1, count++;
We loop through all positions, if it has odd number of divisors, it is ON and hence count + 1.

Unfortunately, it will timeout. How to optimize ?

Observation #3:
Divisors always come in pair. For example:
1: [1,1] --- 2: [1,2] --- 3: [1,3] --- 4: [1,4] [2,2] --- 5:[1,5] --- 6:[1,6][2,3] --- 7:[1,7]
8: [1,8][2,4] --- 9:[1,9][3,3]

In above examples, we know that:
Only when i has perfect square root, its number of divisors is ODD, because it contains duplicated divisor. In above example,
4: [1,2,4] --- 9: [1,3,9]
You can pick any number to examine yourself.

Here comes a better algorithm:
for i = 1...n, if i^2 <= n, count++ ; if i^2 > n, break;
We loop through all position, if i^2 is <= n, that means there exists a valid bulb which has perfect square root i, and we need to count that i^2, so count + 1. If the i^2 exceed n, we can terminate it because we have found all i with perfect square root within n already.

Many of you might have seen the answer, so why the answer can be simply written as Math.sqrt(n) ?
consider n = 9, the process of aforementioned algorithm will be:
check (1 * 1 ) <= 9, count++
check (2 * 2 ) <= 9, count++;
check (3 * 3) <= 9, count++;
check (4 * 4) > 9, break;

We can say, if square root of 9 is 3, that mean 1^2 and 2^2 must exists for n = 9. Hence, the Math.sqrt(i) reflect this fact.
